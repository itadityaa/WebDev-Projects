## Introduction

This repository documents my progression in frontend web development, highlighting the skills, technologies, and projects related to creating engaging and user-friendly user interfaces.

## Beginner Stage

At the beginner stage, I focused on understanding the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Simple static web pages and basic styling were the key areas of exploration.

## Intermediate Stage

In the intermediate stage, I delved into more complex frontend concepts such as responsive design, AJAX, and the utilization of popular libraries and frameworks like Bootstrap and jQuery. Dynamic web pages and enhanced user interfaces became the primary focus.

## Advanced Stage

The advanced stage marks my exploration into advanced frontend development. I dived into modern JavaScript frameworks like React, focusing on building efficient and scalable user interfaces. Topics such as state management, component-based architecture, and asynchronous programming became integral components of this stage.

## Projects Showcase
